# Coding-Quiz
When opening the deployed application you are presented with a coding quiz challenge. When you click the start button your quiz will begin. The goal of the quiz is to answer the questions as fast as you can with getting the most correct for the highest score. If you answer a question incorrectly you will face a 10 second deduction. Your score at the end is based on how much time you have remaining. When finished with the quiz you are prompted to enter your initials to save your score. AFter entering your initials you are brought to a secondary html page to view highscores. From there you can either return to the quiz page or reset the current highscores.
